# `tim7775/cargo-semver`

This package hosts a Luau implementation of the Rust
crate [semver](https://crates.io/crates/semver) (currently version `1.0.20`) and its public Rust-style API. It is not intended for direct
consumption and you should instead be using `tim7775/semver`, which brings a more idiomatic Luau API.
