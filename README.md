## About
The goal of this library is to replicate the exact behavior of the Rust crate [`semver`](https://crates.io/crates/semver) (currently `v1.0.20`) used by [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) (and [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally), [Foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman) and [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit)). It succeeds in this with only minor deviations that should only ever present themselves when dealing with hostile user input.

#### Deviations from Cargo's semver:
1. Identifiers ([Prerelease](https://tim7775.github.io/luau-cargo-semver/api/Prerelease) and [BuildMetadata](https://tim7775.github.io/luau-cargo-semver/api/BuildMetadata)) have a maximum length of 512 characters (Note: This should be more than enough for all use cases. For context, npm has a limit of 256 characters for the complete semver string).
2. Major, minor and patch version numbers overflow at LUAU_MAX_PRECISE_INT (2^53 - 1) instead of u64::MAX (2^63 - 1) (Note: Numbers in identifiers do not have this limitation, they get compared with arbitrary-precision).

## Usage
```lua
local Semver = require("luau-cargo-semver/lib/Semver")

local req = ">=1.2.3, <1.8.0"

-- Check whether this requirement matches version 1.2.3-alpha.1 (no)
assert(not Semver.matches("1.2.3-alpha.1", req), "assertion failed!")

-- Check whether it matches 1.3.0 (yes it does)
assert(Semver.matches("1.3.0", req), "assertion failed!")

-- Compare versions
assert(Semver.cmp("1.3.0", "~=", "1.3.0+build"), "assertion failed!")
assert(Semver.cmpPrecedence("1.3.0", "==", "1.3.0+build"), "assertion failed!")

-- Sort versions array
local versions = { "3.1.2", "1.0.0", "1.0.0-rc.1", "1.0.0-rc.2", "0.3.0-alpha", "0.3.0-beta" }
table.sort(versions, function(a, b)
	return Semver.cmp(a, "<", b)
end)
print(versions)
```
